# Calculus Circle Packing Demo

This repository contains the code for a calculus school project focused on `circle packing`. The goal of this project is to explore the concept of circle packing and its applications in various fields. This was my choosen end of year topic to explore! :D

The project is a work in progress right now, and currently I plan to add more user-interactivity and mathematical modeling to make it more robust.
